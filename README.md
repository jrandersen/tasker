## SECTION 01 Scope:
A task app that is solely meant for a userâ€™s daily tasks. Or in another persepctive "Your daily tasks rollover if not completed".  In this iteration I will implement: <br>
* user Auth
* user Profile. 
* account signup/login/logout. 
* a the main page to input Tasks (full crud). 
* Tasks 
    * add Task to Projects (full crud) 
    * add Notes (full crud)
    * Add Time 
    * add Tags to time (full crud)

As a stretch goal, I would like to make roll-up functions in the project and profile models to graph time. In addition as a stretch, I would like to add google login.
