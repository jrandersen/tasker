# Tasker


// SECTION 01 Scope:
A task app that is only meant for a userâ€™s daily tasks. Or the tasks that the user is going to accomplish today on a given project. Your daily tasks rollover if not completed. Using Django, Postgres & Bulma I believe I can implement
* user auth
* user Profile 
* account signup/login/logout 
* a the main page to input (full crud) 
    * Tasks 
    * add Task to Projects 
    * add Notes
    * Add Time
         * add Tags to time

As a stretch goal, I would like to make roll-up functions in the project and profile models to graph time. In addition as a stretch, I would like to add google login.
